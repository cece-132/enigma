## Solo Project

Run the following to encrypt:

`ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt`

Run the following to decrypt:

`ruby ./lib/decrypt.rb encrypted.txt decrypted.txt 82648 240818`

###Functionality
    - 3.0 program reads and writes to files from the commandline\

###OOP
    - 3.0 the project was broken into logical compinents for me. If I had more time to refactor I would have made my methods a little more clean they were really more bulky than I would have liked. But they are easy to read and understand.

###Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
    - 3.5 although the meat and potatoes of my decrypt and encrypt methods are more than 10 lines long I think that they work really well.
    - overall I think that the naming of all my files make sense and stay true to what I am working on.
###TDD
    - 3.0 I am at 100% coverage!!

###Version control
    - 3.0 My commits weren't quite at 40 but I made them as I got bits of code completed. I think I did them as needed.
